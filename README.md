# ScatterplotAnalysisWithPython
This program is a program using Python to analyze and draw scatterplots with Tkinter and Matplotlib. However, before you are able to run this program you will have to change the file_name variable which is on line 39. You will have to change "/Users/MLee/Desktop/InputData.txt with whatever your filepath is for InputData. You can find the filepath by dragging InputData.txt to terminal or commandline after cloning. After you have changed the file_name variable you will be able to run the program. The program uses the second column as the X axis and the fifth column as the Y axis. After running the program you will notice the X axis is a single digit number even when the second column numbers are in the trillions on the graph. However, the numbers are in single digits because MatPlotLib could not write all the zeroes while still having room for the other numbers in the X axis. Other than that this program will draw the scatter plot from the data, show the mean of both the X and Y axis, and finally show the standard variance of the X and Y axis.
